            <p>
              The goal of this project was to design a short folio about a famous person, making prominent use of type and the grid. While 
              Thomas Edison was chosen as the subject matter for this project, the approach was a contemporary one. The folio instead was 
              designed as though Edison was going to be speaking at a conference soon, and this pamphlet was promoting the event.

                To keep with the notion that this event is a modern one, some modest color correction was done on the image of Thomas Jefferson 
                (photograph from the Wikimedia Commons).

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
              The folio is conceptually bound by two of Edison's famed inventions. The white lines that run through the publication represent 
              electric current, a visual nod to Edison's electric power distribution idea. The yellow fields that grow across the page 
              represent light, referencing (of course) the light bulb, perhaps the best-known of all.
