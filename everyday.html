            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes moods can seem unpredictable when really there is an underlying cause behind it. Everyday is an app designed to 
              let users record their moods and daily behaviors. The hope is that tracking this data will let users notice patterns in how 
              their behavior or habits affect their moods, and lead to better days overall.

            <h3>Creating Better Days</h3>
            <p>
              The core of the app is simple. The dashboard has a calendar in which users can see their moods on any given day, represented 
              by color. Expanding that particular day will reveal what behaviors were logged for that day. For example, a user might notice 
              that an unusually bad day was also a day where they had more coffee than they typically do.

            <h3>All About User Research</h3>
            <p>
              Although the concept sounds simple in theory, there are a lot of complex interactions involved, so the app design process 
              was marked by two rounds of user interviews and testing to validate any assumptions being made.

            <h3>Atomic Design</h3>
            <p>
              Although this app is not currently being developed, it was designed with a future web application in mind. Smaller elements 
              that were repeated across the whole design were created to be consistent and easy to code with CSS later on.

              <h3>User Flow</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to user testing, each phase of the design process was considered with a human-centered perspective. Different 
                use cases were considered with user stories, and navigation was developed with user flow diagrams, even distinguishing 
                between new, starting, and experienced users.

            <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
            <p>
              The research showed that most users have difficulty forming a habit if it is difficult or time-consuming. To prevent this 
              fatigue, the daily log part of the app is designed to only require simple gestural interactions, like swiping. The “continue” 
              button is always in the same place to further expedite interactions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="column span4 animate-fade-in">
            <h3>Signaling Trust</h3>
            <p>
              Since the app is marketed especially to people with mental health concerns, there is considerable emphasis on signaling 
              trust to the user. Things like progress bars and save confirmations exist to let the user have clear expectations about 
              their time and information when using the app.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="column span4 animate-fade-in">
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
              Everyday is a passion project that I strongly believe in and I fully intend to develop it into a functioning web app going 
              forward. To do so will call for more user research and a great deal of development work, but the effort will be worth it to 
              help people understand their mental health in a more proactive way.
