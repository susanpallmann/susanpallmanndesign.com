            <h3>Designer & Developer</h3>
            <p>
              I am a Louisville-based designer/developer/strategist originally from Southern California. I graduated summa cum laude with 
              my BFA in graphic design from University of Louisville in 2020. Since graduating I have worked on over 50 products, 
              websites, and brands as designer, developer, strategist, or some blend of the three. I currently work in Humana's innovation arm, Author by Humana, 
              as an Experience Strategy & Transformation Professional, focused primarily on design strategy.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              I most enjoy finding innovative and compelling ways to tell stories and make an impact in digital spaces. Many of my 
              favorite projects have been with non-profits and organizations that seek to leave the world a better place than we 
              found it.

              Well, close enough.

            <br>
            <p>
              I try to apply the same passion I have for my work to the things I do in my free time, whether that's longboarding, playing video games, or taking 
              care of (probably too many) plants. Since I currently work more on the design strategy side of things, I code personal projects in my free time to
              keep my development skills sharp. I also spend a lot of time learning; it is my opinion that learning is one of the best things one can do in life.
