              This campaign is intended to spread awareness about the above "blue law" and encourage people to leave bigfoot alone. Rather 
              than taking a negative tone, Best Foot Forward reframes the issue, instead inviting people to be kind to bigfoot or have good 
              "bigfoot etiquette." To accomplish this, Bigfoot is portrayed as a friendly, approachable character through the use of clay 
              imagery and the audience is invited to "put their best foot forward."

            <h3>Designed for Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Although the website for this campaign was required to be single-page scrolling, it still needed to invite interest. The original
              design and resulting developed website utilizes interaction to make an otherwise brief experience more meaningful. Interactive elements
              like the scrolling page numbers on desktop, and the Bigfoot "happiness meter" help get the user involved in the narrative.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              The final website's design was a gradual process, beginning with wireframes and early prototypes in Adobe XD. However, the 
              interactive effects were planned based on those found on existing, real websites so that development would not prove to be 
              impossible.

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
              Bigfoot's character design also served as a conceptual foundation for the rest of the project. Part of designing Bigfoot to 
              seem approachable and friendly was giving him brightly colored stripes on his body. This color scheme and stripe pattern was 
              extended to the responsive web campaign, and creates a more memorable characterization. The idea is that people who see this 
              bigfoot with pink and orange stripes will automatically recognize the campaign and recall the message it stands for.

              <h3>Creating Bigfoot</h3>
              <p>
                Another strategy to make Bigfoot seem approachable was to make the character out of clay, a style most people would 
                associate with children's shows or other friendly characters. So, the Bigfoot character shown in the campaign was sculpted 
                out of clay and posed for a photoshoot. Afterwards Photoshop was used to add in backgrounds and clean up imperfections in 
                the sculpture.

            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>
              The campaign was instructed to include a responsive website design (mobile and desktop), as well as three billboards. The 
              website was specified to be a single-page scrolling website similar in style to some of the Ad Council's campaign websites. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
              This project provided the unique opportunity to bring more physical, 3D forms into a primarily digital space. Reframing the 
              issue into something more approachable kept the subject matter fun and inviting. Through the use of bright colors, clay 
              figurines, and a sensitive-looking Bigfoot characterization, this campaign gets its message across as cheerfully as possible.
