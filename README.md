I am a Louisville-based web designer and developer. I am deeply fascinated with telling stories in digital spaces, and I thrive on projects that let me try something new. Let's build something awesome.

This is my portfolio website, coded from scratch.

## Style Notes:
### discount-bootstrap.css
"Discount Bootstrap" is my lightweight take on Bootstrap's responsive grid system. It has its own repository and documentation over at https://github.com/susanpallmann/discount-bootstrap. It provides most of the website structure through use of classes like:
  ```css
  .container
  .row
  .column
  .span12
  .md
  ```

### styles.css
This is the main stylesheet for the website's theme, and where most changes should be made. It has a table of contents in the css file to make navigation easier.
