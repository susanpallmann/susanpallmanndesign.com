## Style Notes:
### discount-bootstrap.css
"Discount Bootstrap" is my lightweight take on Bootstrap's responsive grid system. It has its own repository over at <url>. It provides most of the website structure through use of classes like:
  ```css
  .container
  .row
  .column
  .span12
  .md
  ```

### styles.css
This is the main stylesheet for the website's theme, and where most changes should be made.
